*Acquire the data (or access to the data) listed in the project
resources. This initial collection includes data loading, if necessary,
for data understanding. For example, if you use a specific tool for data
understanding, it makes perfect sense to load your data into this tool.
This effort possibly leads to initial data preparation steps. Note: if
you acquire multiple data sources, integration is an additional issue,
either here or in the later data preparation phase.*

-   *List the dataset(s) acquired,*

-   *together with their locations,*

-   *the methods used to acquire them,*

-   *and any problems encountered.*

*Record problems encountered and any resolutions achieved. This will aid
with future replication of this project or with the execution of similar
future projects.*
