Project Plan

*Describe the intended plan for achieving the project goals and thereby
achieving the business goals. The plan should specify the steps to be
performed during the rest of the project, including the initial
selection of tools and techniques.*

-   *List the stages to be executed in the project, together with their
    duration, resources required, inputs, outputs, and dependencies.
    Where possible, make explicit the large-scale iterations in the data
    mining process—for example, repetitions of the modeling and
    evaluation phases.*

-   *As part of the project plan, it is also important to analyze
    dependencies between time schedule and risks. Mark results of these
    analyses explicitly in the project plan, ideally with actions and
    recommendations if the risks are manifested.*

-   *Note: the project plan contains detailed plans for each phase.
    Decide at this point which evaluation strategy will be used in the
    evaluation phase.*

-   *The project plan is a dynamic document in the sense that at the end
    of each phase, a review of progress and achievements is necessary,
    and a corresponding update of the project plan is recommended.
    Specific review points for these updates are part of the project
    plan.*

# Initial assessment of tools and techniques

*At the end of the first phase, an initial assessment of tools and
techniques should be performed. Here, for example, you select a data
mining tool that supports various methods for different stages of the
process. It is important to assess tools and techniques early in the
process since the selection of tools and techniques may influence the
entire project.*

# Stakeholders

*Identifying ALL stakeholders and their involvement in the project no
matter how small is crucial.*
