*Examine the quality of the data, addressing questions such as: Is the
data complete (does it cover all the cases required)? Is it correct, or
does it contain errors and, if there are errors, how common are they?
Are there missing values in the data? If so, how are they represented,
where do they occur, and how common are they?*

-   *List the results of the data quality verification.*

-   *if quality problems exist, list possible solutions.*

-   *Solutions to data quality problems generally depend heavily on both
    data and business knowledge.*
